# Roland M3 Sample
Go to: https://github.com/Missamess/SoundLab/tree/main/RolandM3 This repo has all the .WAV files used for the instrument.
I sampled each note with a basic setup on the M3. Only one sample for each key was taken. I also used Drum Rack to program the notes, added distortion to some of the notes, added reverb too.
